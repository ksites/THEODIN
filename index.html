  <p>This is a paragram text on this webpage, it basically put text in the paragraph so it wont mix with other part of the text</p>
  <p><strong> this is another paragraph which will be big with random text <em> took a sip of the drink.</em></strong> He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. <strong> made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent. </strong></p>
<!--This HTML comment,I created this paragraph and used emphasis to see it working-->
<!--you can use b and i tag to make text bold and italic but not recommened because browser understands it better-->
  <p><em>So this is another paragraph which will be big with random text He took a sip of the drink.</em> He wasn't sure whether he liked it or not, but at this moment it didn't matter. She had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it. That's simply the way things worked. She made him a new-fangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled, saying it was excellent. </p>

  <p>Now, this a Second paragraph using the same p tag, as you can see it is seperated from the previous paragraph</p>
